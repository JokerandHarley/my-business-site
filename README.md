# [Your Name] — Handyman Starter Site

This is a minimal starter site for a handyman. Replace the placeholders and deploy.

Quick edits:
- Replace: [YOUR PHONE], [YOUR EMAIL], [YOUR_CALENDLY_LINK], [YOUR-GMB-LINK], [YOUR-YELP-LINK], [Your Name].
- Replace the Formspree action: https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id (get a free form id at https://formspree.io/).
- If using Netlify Forms change the form to:
  <form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true"> and follow Netlify docs.

Deploy (GitHub Pages):
1. Push files to your repo’s main branch.
2. In repo Settings → Pages, set source to Branch: main / root (or use gh-pages).
3. Save — the site will be published at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo> (may take a minute).

Deploy (Netlify):
1. Create free Netlify account at https://app.netlify.com/.
2. Drag & drop your site folder to the Sites panel OR connect the GitHub repo.
3. Enable Netlify Forms if you used data-netlify="true".

If you want, I can:
- Create the GitHub repo and push these files for you (tell me repo name and public/private), or
- Walk you step-by-step while you create the repo (I’ll give exact clicks/commands).
